There will be times when you want to sell a product that is displayed on your site, but there is another version of it available with extra add-ons or even with new and additional features in it for less price.

As an example, if you are a gift card seller you may want to offer a gift card bundle in your single product page(s) and promote that package with giving extra credit to your customers! Same as what we regularly see on Amazon website.

This feature could be helpful if::

* You want to promote your bundle or group product.
* You can offer premium or pro version of an existing free or freemium product.
* You want to notify your customers for a newer version of the current or discontinued product.

In addition to the features mentioned above with using Woo Product Suggest plugin, you don't need to remove your discontinued or out of stock products from your e-commerce store anymore. Instead, you can link them to the newer or more related version of them and most importantly keep your SEO juice safe!

You can naturally boost your custom product sale or promote your new product launches!
